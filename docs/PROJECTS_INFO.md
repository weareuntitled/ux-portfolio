| **Category** | Enterprise |
| **Client** | Automotive (Konzern) |
| **Roles** | Product Designer, Scrum Master |
| **Team size** | 4–6 devs, 2 designers |
| **Tags** | compliance, enterprise, automotive, product-management |
| **Case study** | Yes (`caseStudyBySlug.kovon`) |
| **Portfolio Kit** | Yes (process steps, feature items) |
| **Technical specs** | Yes |
| **Links** | Case study → `/projects/kovon` |
| **Prototype** | — |
| **Impact** | 500–1,000 Potential Users · POC 10 / MVP 50 / Beta 1,000 Users · 3 years Time Frame · Documentation of Conformity (COP) · Work & Regulation Structure (update concept) · Angular · AWS · Functionalities (6 role dashboards, evaluation concept, management site) |
| **Tools** | Angular, AWS |
| **Methods** | Process definition with client, Stakeholder interviews, User tests, Scrum and product management |

**Problem:** Automotive teams needed a single place to document and prove Conformity of Production (COP). Documentation was scattered; regulation required audit-proof evidence. Teams needed an integrated role, task and regulation concept to scale COP documentation.

**Approach:** Designed and validated KoVoN as a pilot web tool with integrated role, task and regulation concept. Delivered a scalable COP compliance documentation tool to gather insights and prove scalability around Online Conformity of Production. COFON translated the learnings into a maintainable concept and governance model.

**Outcome:** A validated scalable pilot web tool with integrated role, task and regulation concept. Insights and proven scalability around Online Conformity of Production (COP), with a foundation for holistic compliance documentation.

**Strong bullets:** Delivered holistic COP compliance documentation tool KoVoN as a validated pilot web tool; integrated role, task and regulation concept; gathered insights and proved scalability around Online Conformity of Production (COP); produced a maintainable concept and governance model for future rollout.

**Do NOT imply:** Company-wide rollout (→ pilot web tool, validated scalability); high adoption (→ validated workflow, proven scalability); permanent solution (→ foundation for holistic compliance documentation).
